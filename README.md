# Project Euler Solved Problems
This repository has been set up to solve the Project Euler problems, found [here](https://projecteuler.net/). Solutions are language agnostic, and will be grouped per problem, allowing for multiple solutions per problem, based on the language of choice.

If you are contributing to this space, please add any relevant rules to the `.gitignore` file, as you see fit. This can include any compiled files that are created as a result of your solution, any cached files based on imports you use (such as those that occur in Python, for example), or any editor specific files that you might use.
