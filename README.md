# Project Euler Solved Problems
This repository has been set up to solve the Project Euler problems, found [here](https://projecteuler.net/). Solutions are language agnostic, and will be grouped per problem, allowing for multiple solutions per problem, based on the language of choice.

If you are contributing to this space, please add any relevant rules to the `.gitignore` file, as you see fit. This can include any compiled files that are created as a result of your solution, any cached files based on imports you use (such as those that occur in Python, for example), or any editor specific files that you might use.

## General Guidelines
When adding a solution to a certain problem, please adhere to the following file naming format: `problem-XXX/Solution.*`. Directories should denote the problem number (leading zeroes for preliminary problems are not necessary), and your solution file should be named as shown.

In the event that you want to upload a solution in a programming language that already exists in a certain problem's directory, please use the format `problem-XXX/language/Solution_XXX.*`, so that solutions coded under the same programming language can be grouped, with no one's work being lost. Make sure that you increment your solution's number based on the last number that was used, in the same format described above.

Please be sure to do a `git pull` into your local repository whenever you decide to work on problems, in order to minimize merge conflicts or other problems. Since we will not be doing Pull Requests into this repository, doing a `git pull` is vital to ensuring you stay up to date as we work on these problems together.
